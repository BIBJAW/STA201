## Chapter 7: Writing Routine and Positive Messages

### 7.1 : Strategy for routine requests:

> Making requests is a routine part of business. In most cases, your audience will be prepared to comply, as long as you’re not being unreasonable or asking people to do something they would expect you to do yourself. By applying a clear strategy and tailoring your approach to each situation, you’ll be able to generate effective requests quickly.
> 
> 
> Like all other business messages, routine requests have three parts: an opening, a body, and a close. Using the direct approach, open with your main idea, which is a clear statement of your request. Use the body to give details and justify your request, then close by requesting specific action.

#### Starting your request up front :

- Pay attention to tone
- Assume that your audience will comply
- Be specific

#### Explaining and justifying your request

- Use the body for explanation
- Make the explanation a smooth and logical outgrowth of your opening remarks.
- Ask the most important question first if have any
- Break things down if have a complex request 

#### Requesting Specific actions in a courteous close:

Close the message with three important elements:

- A specific request that includes any relevant deadlines
- Information about how you can be reached
- An expression of appreciation or goodwill

### 7.2 : Common examples of routine requests:

#### Asking for information or actions:

Routine requests can have up to three basic elements:

- What you want to know / what you want the readers to do
- Why you are making the request
- Why it may be in your readers' interest to help you

#### Asking for recommendations:

- Always ask for permission before using someone as a reference
- Refresh the memory of any potential reference you haven't bee in touch with for a while
- Close the message with an expression of appreciation

#### Making claim and requesting adjustments:

> If you’re dissatisfied with a company’s product or service, you can opt to make a claim (a formal complaint) or request an adjustment (a settlement of a claim). In either case, it’s important to maintain a professional tone in all your communication, no matter how angry
> or frustrated you are. Keeping your cool will help you get the situation resolved sooner.

- Open with a clear and calm statement along with your request
- Explain the details and problems
- Request specific actions politely
- Declare the relationship will continue if the problems are solved

### 7.3: Strategy for routine replies and positive messages:

> Just as you’ll make numerous requests for information and action throughout your career, you’ll also respond to similar requests from other people. When you are responding positively to a request, sending routine announcements, or sending a positive or goodwill message, you have several goals: 
> 
> - to communicate the information or the good news
> -  answer all questions, 
> - provide all required details, and
> - leave your reader with a good impression of you and your firm.

#### Starting with main idea:

> By opening with the main idea or good news, you prepare your audience for the details that follow. Make your opening clear and concise. Although the following introductory statements make the same point, one is cluttered with unnecessary information that buries the purpose, whereas the other is brief and to the point:
